# Disclaimer before you continue

This is a Work in progress. the majority of example puzzles work (except rigid bodies, realtime games, sounds and some prelude fields)

But if this project is interesting to you, consider contributing! Making a new implementation of PuzzleScript is a huge undertaking. I look forward to making puzzles with you.

## Puzzles known to work

- Stumper test puzzle
- Simple Block Pushing Game
- EYE EYE EYE
- Match 3 Block Push
- Block Faker
- constellation z
- Kettle
- Lime Rick
- Match 3 Block Push
- Microban
- neko puzzle
- Notsnake
- Octat
- Zen Puzzle Garden

- Watch Your Step

## Contributing puzzle tests

If you have a puzzle you would like to add to the test suite you can add the puzzle to the `puzzles/` directory with the `.puzz` extension and add a test solution to the `runnerTest.c` test file. Look at `test_runs_stumper` for a simple example.

# Puzzle Engine

A C implementation of the PuzzleScript language and runtime

It has a number of renders you can use:

## 3d

# Text Only

![Text Puzzle](./img/nc_puzzlescript.gif)

## Required libs

Thanks for inspiring me with the line in the FAQ saying:

> it'd be too much fuss to keep a separate C implemention of PuzzleScript synchronised with the main one. But if you want to try to do so, knock yourself out : )

I use a number of puzzles to test my parsing and rule application work correctly, thanks to those puzzle creators I am happy to remove any puzzles you wish I didn't copy.
