TODO:
- redo the current level as "layers"

- replace malloc strcpy with strdup
- validate object names used in rules exist or are `...`

- When PS finds a circular rule it only applies the right and down versions
- redo active level as layers
- maybe just objects with x,y
- Need a concept for the match data like `...` distance for when it gets applied
- sounds
