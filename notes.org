TODO:
- validate object names used in rules exist or are `...`
- validate has background
- make sure all objects are in a layer
- maybe just objects with x,y
- Need a concept for the match data like `...` distance for when it gets applied
- sounds
- "levels must be rectangular" We don't have to do this, but can.
- There are some helpful errors we can add like direction in `late` rules will never match right?
- When applying directions, the last rule that applies the direction always wins. This can be confusing and could give a warning. It might be hard to warn about because it has to be proved that the match is identical

- PS doesn't do this, but [ > One Two ] makes no sense and should probably error. Or apply only to the first object
- the direction handling in rules should move down a level. I think we can parse direction and legendId together and it will be cleaner/make more sense


3d api:
- transfer levels with `lift` and `lower`
- maybe specify 3d levels with,

good rule debug:
        if (0 && debug() && aliasLegendContains(legendId, rt->objects[j].objId) == 1) {
          printf("RULE MATCH STATUS ('%s')\ncontains: %i\nlocation %i\ndirection: %i\n------\n",
                 objectName(rt->objects[j].objId),
                 aliasLegendContains(legendId, rt->objects[j].objId),
                 ((objectX == currentX && objectY == currentY) ||
                  (anyDistance == 1 && matchAtDistance(dir, currentX, currentY, objectX, objectY))),
                 matchesDirection(ruleDir, dir, directionMoving(rt, j))
                 );
        }
