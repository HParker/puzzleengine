TODAY:
- redo legend as key -> list of objects
- redo the current level as "layers"

TODO:
- sounds
- replace malloc strcpy with strdup
- support multiple colors
- validate object names used in rules exist or are `...`
- validate has background
- make sure all objects are in a layer
- When PS finds a circular rule it only applies the right and down versions
- redo active level as layers (maybe just objects with x,y)?
- Need a concept for the match data like `...` distance for when it gets applied
- Object id is not uniq. I need to use their indexes instead more.
