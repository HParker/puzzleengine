TODO:
- smooth movement for a new demo
- We need to do rule expansion after parsing. handling relative directions where not that difficult, but `moving` is challenging.
  Since [ > this ] only applies to one thing, it is easy to implement directly, however
  [ moving this ] [ that ] -> [ moving this ] [ moving that] moving always has to be the same.
  We don't currently maintain any kind of state between []s and I don't want to start.
- should `ObjectGlyph` be ncurses renderer specific?
  seems unlikely we would need to show the character in any other context.
- validate object names used in rules exist or are `...`
- validate has background
- make sure all objects are in a layer
- sounds
- validate "levels must be rectangular" We don't have to do this, but can.
- There are some helpful errors we can add like direction in `late` rules will never match.
- When applying directions, the last rule that applies the direction always wins. This can be confusing and could give a warning. It might be hard to warn about because it has to be proved that the match is identical

3d api:
- transfer levels with `lift` and `lower`
- maybe specify 3d levels with,
